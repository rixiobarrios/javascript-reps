// Arrays

// Organizing and storing data is a foundational concept of programming.

// One way we organize data in real life is by making lists. Let’s make one here:

// New Year's Resolutions:

// 1. Keep a journal
// 2. Take a falconry class
// 3. Learn to juggle
// Let’s now write this list in JavaScript, as an array:

// let newYearsResolutions = [
//     'Keep a journal',
//     'Take a falconry class',
//     'Learn to juggle',
// ];

// console.log(newYearsResolutions);

// Accessing Elements
// Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the item’s position.

// Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0. Let’s see how we could access an element in an array:

let cities = ['Chicago', 'Beijing', 'Dubai'];

// Access first city through bracket notation
console.log(cities[0]);

// Access first letter of first city through bracket notation
console.log(cities[0][0]);

// let concepts = ['creating arrays', 'array structures', 'array manipulation'];

// console.log(concepts);
