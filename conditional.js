// CONDITIONALS
// Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.

// There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including:

// “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.
// “Else” statements: where if the same condition is false it specifies the execution for a block of code.
// “Else if” statements: this specifies a new test if the first condition is false.
// Now that you have the basic JavaScript conditional statement definitions, let’s show you examples of each.

if (10 > 5) {
    console.log('10 is greater then 5');
} else {
    console.log('5 is not greater then 10');
}
