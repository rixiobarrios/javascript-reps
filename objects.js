//OBJECTS

// Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

// In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

// const myCar = {
//     make: 'Ford',
//     model: 'Mustang',
//     year: 1969,
// };
// console.log(myCar);

// // Create an object-------------------------------------------

// const objA = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 1 };
// const objB = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 1 };
// const objC = { a: 1, b: 2, d: 1 };
